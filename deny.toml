    # RUSTSEC-2025-0052: async-std project discontinued
    # - NOT a security vulnerability, just a project status notice
    # - async-std is an optional runtime for users who prefer it over tokio
    # - The crate remains functional and sound, just no longer actively maintained
    # - Users who need long-term support should use the default tokio runtime

    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: rsa crate Marvin Attack timing sidechannel
    # - Affects RSA decryption via timing analysis, medium severity (5.9)
    # - Pulled in transitively through sqlx-mysql, even when only using sqlite
    # - This is a known sqlx issue: https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx/issues/2911
    # - Our database-server-example ONLY uses sqlite, not MySQL
    # - No network-accessible RSA operations are performed in our code

    # RUSTSEC-2024-0436: paste crate no longer maintained
    # - Only pulled in through rmcp (dev-dependency for comparison benchmarks)
    # - Not used in production code paths
