    # RUSTSEC-2025-0052: async-std project discontinued
    # - This is NOT a security vulnerability, just a project status notice
    # - async-std is an optional runtime for users who prefer it over tokio
    # - The crate remains functional and sound, just no longer actively maintained
    # - Users who need long-term support should use the default tokio runtime
    # - See: https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0052
